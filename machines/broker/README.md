# Exploit for ActiveMQ 5.15.15

1. Make yourself a python virtual environment and install the packages in the requirements.txt
2. Update all `TODO` sections in the activemq_exploit_server.py
3. Start the flask server by running `python activemq_exploit_server.py`
4. Update all `TODO` sections in the exploit.py
5. Run `python exploit.py`
6. You should see the flask server got a callback from the target server... it *should* have executed the code you specified. lol idk
